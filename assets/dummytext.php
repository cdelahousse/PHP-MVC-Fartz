				<p>Paragraphs are the core building block of typography online. You want to make sure you've got a good line-height and horizontal width—aka measure—for good readability. If you stack your lines too close together, or too far apart, lines become harder to read. Like a staircase where the steps are too shallow or too steep. The standard line-height online is something between 1.5 and 2.0 ems.<sup><a href="#ems">1</a></sup> If your lines stretch too far across the page reading can feel like a tedious marathon. The standard single-column width online is about 70-90 characters.</p>

				<p>If you look at the source code you'll notice how the .sidenote to the right was written before this paragraph, which it is supposed to directly relate to. You'll probably want to set up your asides in the same manner.</p>
				<p>These are the simple beginnings of Type-a-file. We've put in a lot of work to make good typography easier for you. Colors &amp; structure we leave to you, but typographically, we got you covered. Download the file and follow the instructions for installing and setting it up. Now we'll get into some of the <em>fancier</em> elements we've built into Type-a-file.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>This is a list that is well ordered.</li>
					<li>It starts with one and goes to two.</li>
					<li>Then it has a third item.</li>
					<li>Followed by the fourth, and—in this case—last item.</li>
				</ol>

				<ul>
					<li>Un-ordered lists are just as simple.</li>
					<li>The only difference being that the items are marks by bullets instead of numbers.</li>
					<li>Don't forget that lists can have list titles.</li>
					<li>Finally we've reached the last un-ordered item.</li>

				<blockquote><p>Headings, subheads, block quotations, footnotes, illustrations, captions and other intrusions into the text create syncopations and variations against the base rhythm of regularly leaded lines. These variations can and should add life to the page, but the main text should also return after each variation precisely on beat and in phase.</p></blockquote>
